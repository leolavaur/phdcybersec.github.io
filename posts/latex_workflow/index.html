    <h1 id="over-engineered-scientific-paper-writing">Over-engineered scientific paper writing</h1>
<p>A few weeks ago, I received comments from reviewers after I submitted my first scientific paper.
While reading through the instructions, I encountered the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>While addressing comments of reviewers and revising your paper, please mark any text you update
or add with a special color (e.g., blue), so that reviewers can easily notice your revisions.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At first, I thought about making a macro that adds color, and using that macro every time I make a
change. But an issue appears then: how do I produce the final PDF? If I change the macro definition
to remove color, I have <em>ghost</em> macros that do not do anything in my source code. That is not very
portable. I could also use some sort of <em>regex</em> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> to delete all occurrences of my macro, and
risk tampering with my document by doing so.</p>
<p>Therefore, I started defining specifications for a writing workflow that would work. Here is what I
came up with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Modifications must not require extra steps, <em>i.e.</em> no macro.</li>
<li>Highlighting modifications must be easy, and automated.</li>
<li>Every major update of the paper must be kept independently.</li>
<li>Resources (<em>e.g.</em> bibliography, glossary, …) must be accessible to each paper.</li>
<li>The workflow must be straightforward.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="introduction-to-my-environment">Introduction to my environment</h2>
<p>There are a lot of ways to write LaTeX. Online with a service like <a href="//overleaf.com">Overleaf</a>,
offline with a TeX editor like <a href="https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/">Texmaker</a>, or you can write <em>by
hand</em> and compile yourself. I chose a hybrid approach with <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>
and <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop">LaTeX Workshop</a>.
Coming from a developer background, I’m used to (and enjoy!) writing in text editors, and VSCode has
become my <em>go-to</em> for the past years. LaTeX Workshop is an extension that more-or-less mimic the
experience of a fully-featured IDE like Overleaf. This has two advantages: (1) files are offline, I
do not rely on an internet connection to work; (2) I control everything, from the packages installed
on my system, to the latex engine I use to compile my documents.</p>
<p>To generate PDFs, many LaTeX engines and distributions exists. I settled on <a href="https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/en-US/">Tectonic
Typesetting</a>, which provides a bundle with a fork on
XeTeX, and automatically downloads the packages and resources it needs to compile PDFs. I also keep
a full <a href="https://www.tug.org/texlive/">TexLive</a> distribution, in case of offline work. This way, I
can use both LaTeX Workshop and my terminal to generate documents; I know what works and what does
not, and why. Compiling my work is then as simple as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ ls

<h2 id="versioning-with-git">Versioning with Git</h2>
<p>Objective <strong>#3</strong> requires that I be able to keep every major updates of my work. And while I like to
be able to work without internet access, having backups online is pretty useful.
<a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> solves both issues. Git is what we call a versioning program, or Version
Control System, and is at the core of most modern developers&rsquo; workflow. It allows developers to keep
a track of their changes in time, create different versions of their work, and above all collaborate
with others. Therefore, I extensively use git in all my projects, managing a plethora of
repositories.</p>
<p>Git tracks changes with commits, which is a record of all modifications made since the last known
state. You can use commits to rollback to a previous state, and see the differences between
versions. Branches are pointers to a series of commits that forked from the <em>main</em> (or <em>master</em>)
branch. They are less useful when you work alone, but absolutely essential when collaborating with
others.</p>
<p><img src="/images/git.drawio.png" alt="Git branches and tags"><!-- {"width":551} --></p>
<p>One of Git’s features particularly shines to solve <strong>#3</strong>:
<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging">tags</a>. A tag is an immutable branch that
points to a specific commit. It can be seen as a saved version of your work. When working on
software, it allows you to tag releases, allowing users to fetch a specific version. But for paper
writing, it enables quick comparison between versions of your work. Git supports two types of tags
that you can use: <em>lightweight</em> tags and <em>annotated</em> tags.</p>
<p>The <em>lightweight</em> nothing more than a branch. It has a name, and once it has been created,
modification will not be committed to it. An <em>annotated</em> tag, on the other hand, is stored as a full
Git object, which also mean that you can add a description to it. It can be useful to remember what
release contained what. Here is an example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ git commit -m <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;update: basic readme; add: paper.tex&#34;</span>
<span style="color:#f92672">[</span>main b8d7331<span style="color:#f92672">]</span> update: basic readme; add: paper.tex
 <span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span> files changed, <span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span> insertions<span style="color:#f92672">(</span>+<span style="color:#f92672">)</span>
 create mode <span style="color:#ae81ff">100644</span> paper.tex

$ git tag v0.1

$ git tag

<span style="color:#75715e"># do some commits</span>
$ git tag -a <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;v1.2&#34;</span> -m <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;version with related works&#34;</span>

$ git tag
v0.1
v0.2

<span style="color:#75715e"># upload your tags</span>
git push --tags
</code></pre></div><p>You will not directly see the difference between <em>lightweight</em> and <em>annotated</em> tags, but it will
appear on your web interface, and can also be seen with <code>git show &lt;tag_name&gt;</code>.  Since tags work
pretty much like immutable branches, you can use the <code>checkout</code>command to go back to a tag’s state.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ ls

$ git checkout v1.0 <span style="color:#75715e"># let&#39;s say you added readme in v1.2</span>

$ ls
build  figures  paper.tex  resources 
</code></pre></div><h2 id="synchronizing-resources">Synchronizing resources</h2>
<p>Objective <strong>#4</strong> states: <em>Resources (<em>e.g.</em> bibliography, glossary, …) must be accessible to each
paper.</em></p>
<p>When working on your first paper, putting everything inside your project (<em>e.g.</em> your Git
repository) is easy, and works pretty well. However, it does not scale well: how to you work on two
papers at the same time? How can you keep your bibliography consistent between your papers? What if
you wish to start working on your thesis manuscript, reusing previous works? You need <em>something</em>,
available in all your repositories, that is ensured to be the same for all.</p>
<p>Git <em><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule">submodules</a></em> provide such a functionality. Their
goal is to import a Git repository <em>inside</em> another, and potentially inside several others. Having
your shared resources synced in every project removes a tremendous amount of tinkering, and dealing
with inconsistencies. So let&rsquo;s have a look:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ ls 
README.md  build  figures  paper.tex

$ git submodule add git@github.com:phdcybersec/latex-article-bootstrap-resources.git resources

$ ls 
README.md  build  figures  paper.tex  resources
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, a new directory <em>resources</em> is now available, and contains the cloned repository.
The submodule acts like an independent Git repository, which means you can pull, commit, and push
within this repository like you would have normally done. However, unlike a simple repository, the
submodule and its path are synced on the remote branch, which means that you can see it on any other
up-to-date local copy. In the context of writing TeX, it is particularly useful to share
bibliography, glossary, or a custom <em>.sty</em> packages.</p>
<p>The workflow slightly differs when working with submodules:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#75715e"># clone a repository and its submodules</span>
git clone --recursive &lt;address&gt;

<span style="color:#75715e"># pull changes for all submodules in a repository</span>
git submodules foreach git pull

<span style="color:#75715e"># commit and push changes in a submodule</span>
cd path/to/submodule
git commit -am <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;commit message&#34;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&amp;&amp;</span> git push
</code></pre></div><h2 id="highlighting-modifications">Highlighting modifications</h2>
<p>We finally get to why I’ve started to work on this in the first place: being able to show to the
reviewers what changed since the last time, solving <strong>#1</strong> and <strong>#2</strong>. Moreover, now that we are
able to keep track of versions, we can compare them! After a bit of searching around, I came across
<a href="https://www.ctan.org/pkg/latexdiff?lang=en">latexdiff</a>. Pretty much as the <code>diff</code> Unix command
that shows the differences between two files, <code>latexdiff</code> produces a new TeX file for you to
compile, that highlights the changes you’ve made.</p>
<p>Here is an example where I downloaded my work at tag &ldquo;v1.0&rdquo; and placed it in <code>/tmp</code>, in order to
compare it with my current version. Since <code>latexdiff</code> generates a TeX file, you can chain the
command with a TeX compiler, here Tectonic.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ git clone -b <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;v1.0&#34;</span> --single-branch git@github.com:phdcybersec/latex-article-bootstrap.git /tmp/paper-v1.0

$ latexdiff /tmp/paper-v1.0/paper.tex ./paper.tex | tectonic -
</code></pre></div><p><img src="images/paper-latexdiff.png" alt="Example of diff PDF"><!-- {"width":408} --></p>
<p>However, TeX project are rarely that simple,
and are often split as they grow. However, <code>latexdiff</code> is only able to take atomic files to
compare—excluding the images, bibliographies, and such external resources. The <code>--flatten</code> option
can be used to <em>flatten</em> the input documents, by looking at <code>\input</code> or <code>\include</code> LaTeX commands,
and pasting the according files&rsquo; content in their place. This approach has some caveats, and might
break when encountering unusual code, like includes inside macros, or complex tables. You can check
that your LaTeX document support <em>flattening</em> by using a similar tool called <code>latexpand</code> (both
<code>latexdiff</code> and this one are available in CTAN repositories).</p>
<p>Automating the generation a <em>diff</em> file with a tag could be easily done: download the version of
your Git repository at a specified tag, <em>flatten</em> both your old and new versions, generate your
<em>diff</em> file, and build the according PDF. Fortunately, there already exists a tool that does just
that: <a href="https://gitlab.com/git-latexdiff/git-latexdiff">￼<code>git-latexdiff</code>￼</a>. This is the keystone
of this whole workflow.</p>
<p>Available as both an executable and a git subcommand, <code>git-latexdiff</code> allows you to automate the
aforementioned operations, in one command. Here is an example with our repository:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#75715e"># opens paper.pdf in default viewer</span>
$ git latexdiff --main paper.tex --tectonic <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;v1.0&#34;</span> --
</code></pre></div><p>Now I can write, with tagged version to which I can come back to, with an automated generation of
the changes between versions. That covers my objectives <strong>#1</strong> through <strong>#3</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>Merging all information above leads to an efficient workflow that checks <strong>#5</strong>. It is easy,
automated, and provides reproducibility (one tag, one PDF). I can highlight differences between
versions, thus providing reviewers with a high-quality <em>diff</em> file. More importantly, it is highly
portable, adaptable, and extensible. The techs used here are standards, there are no underground
self-made pieces of codes that could break; and Git can integrate with pretty much everything, from
your shell to your favorite TeX editor.</p>
